files:
kmeansserver.py
mnistloader.py
index.html
main.css
main.js

usage:
running kmeansserver.py will open a server on localhost:8080 that serves cluster requests to a client

mnistloader.py is a 3rd party library for downloading MNIST db.
to avoid frequent downloads the db is saved to mnist.pkl

I used:
http.server for server-client communication
numpy,PIL for array manipulation
base64 for string formatting
sklearn for kMeans algorithm
